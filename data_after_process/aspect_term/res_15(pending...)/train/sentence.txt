judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny

those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece
hurley 's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came

when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no
then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes
such a disappointment

first of all , this place is romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on

service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora

problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
no plans to return anytime soon

the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him where are you from maybe you do nt know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
we did tip , i guess the model waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager

i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
never again !

but 1 for each small piece
not worth it

was n't going to share but i feel obligated while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
no thanks ! ! !
this place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !

we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
we were then shooed inside
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we left , never to return
with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care

the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
he offers subpar service and has no personality
in fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
there is no excuse for such lousy service !
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri
you can do it here
20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten

the food is great
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
i heartily recommend
there is a downside if you 're ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath i live in a walkup who always seem disappointed with their tips
