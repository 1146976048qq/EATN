this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made even the gyro meat and sausages , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected

the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom
when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession
we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service

but 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine
look , the appetizers were really good
the entree was also very good
ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced
what you are paying for is the environment and the name
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe
vanison was good but not amazing
bison was quite excellent however
dessert pure disaster
just not good at all

once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
our experience did not ever get any better
for each course we waited over hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i would not expect this for a 55 dinner

do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded ''
the food arrived in about 15 minutes
i had the thai style fried sea bass which was very good

i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is 25 , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel

also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost
i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price

for starters they delivered us someone else 's order
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin

my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation

none was made so i hung up
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant

the was horrible
easily the worst squid i ' ve ever tasted
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service
she just nodded and walked off
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish
we were charged full price
lives up to the hype
we ' ve tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations
it was well worth the wait
the wife had the risotto which was amazing
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty

the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out
supercilious scorn is in
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious

at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !

the frizzy retro girl with dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to '' that night wtf
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're talking about
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee

while finishing our meals which included a bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening
a word to the wise you ca n't dine here and disturb the 's sense of table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else
if you go here , do it on his

had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour
when the main course finally arrived another half of our order was missing
never got an explanation as to what was going on
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues

the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , can i help you '' and how many are in your party ''
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were
we did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem

i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it
i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff
