i do n't know if i 'll be back
mama mia i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead
but once done , it 's not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce

what may be interesting to most is the worst comes from the owners of this establishment
this establishment really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of food televisions diners , , and dives '' hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the dive '' category
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was
untill this happens , my advice is to stay away

once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal

this was great dining experience
if you 're going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n't miss this one

seabass on lobster risotto was the best
caesar salad was superb

even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 discount on our bill
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks
it was clear he did n't really care
avoid the place
save yourself the waste of time do not visit
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy the service was horrible !
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy the service was horrible !
i waited for minutes for service ordered a beer was never served again
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left
i went home looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service deceptive link
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks kept telling us she 'd be right with us
we left without ever getting service
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again it still does n't work
best crab cakes in town
that s a big statement considering i ' ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese
first off , the food came fast and all together SMILE i like that i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter soooo good the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty

not chewy at all
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee oh la la yummy ! ! !
melt in your mouth
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel but they are definitely one you do nt want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose
chintzy portions
the sushi here is perfectly good , but for 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant even for nyc
we easily spent more than 40 per person not including alcohol and were still hungry

we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !
none that i can think of
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later with our main course
um so now what are appetizers for
oh i forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and i guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it
in other words , if they are n't making off of you then you do n't rate high on their service scale
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park
its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides

while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service
while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been blown off '' would be an understatement
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name
in short , schooner or later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment
you are with a hot date and has an urge for sushi then this might be the place
great service
good sake selection
dungeness crabs here !
ray 's is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !
i love dungeness crabs and at ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting !
and the service was simply spendid quite a delight

the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially

it s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste

though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature msg taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting very light and
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner

it 's a tiny place so if you get there before on a weekend thurs sun you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar
once you 're inside , the real experience begins
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa
the sushi is as fresh as it comes you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !

maybe i 'll go back once more many years from now when i ' ve forgotten i went there already

portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater

to start off , approximately oz of orange juice will cost you 3
they serve it in a tall , skinny shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket

i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray 's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations
ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thing about ray 's !

my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce

two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table
