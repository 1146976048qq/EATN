judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny

when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong

then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes
such a disappointment

kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
overall i would recommend it and go back again

mmmmm it was delicious
service was slow , but the people were friendly

first of all , this place is romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on

service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora

problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
no plans to return anytime soon
this place is so much fun

the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him where are you from maybe you do nt know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
we did tip , i guess the model waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager

i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
never again !

we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
we were then shooed inside
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we left , never to return

i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
great find in the west village !
maggot in the food !

the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom
when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession
we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service

i was speechless by the horrible food
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing

but 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine
look , the appetizers were really good
the entree was also very good
ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced
what you are paying for is the environment and the name
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe
vanison was good but not amazing
bison was quite excellent however
dessert pure disaster
just not good at all
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all

we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table
although we were told minutes and it was more like 45 minutes
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited
the place is beautiful !
the hostess was very pleasant
however , our 14 drinks were were horrible !
however , our 14 drinks were were horrible !
once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
our experience did not ever get any better
for each course we waited over hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i would not expect this for a 55 dinner

by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and some of which we never received !
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !
to top it all the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant

do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded ''
the food arrived in about 15 minutes
i had the thai style fried sea bass which was very good
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !

great indian food
food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is 25 , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel

also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost
i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin

my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation

none was made so i hung up
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out
supercilious scorn is in
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent

at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !

if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews
well they can run but they ca n't hide
this place god where do i begin
it is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come ! ! ! !

how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me

though it 's been crowded most times i ' ve gone here , bark always delivers on their food

only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu
but nonetheless great spot , great food

fabulous food if the front of house staff do n't put you off

it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff not the waiters they 're fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return

as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

the frizzy retro girl with dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to '' that night wtf
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're talking about
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee
considering you will spend at least 60 a head , i expect better service

so , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first
eat and get out ''
the food and service were fine , however the was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant

while finishing our meals which included a bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening
a word to the wise you ca n't dine here and disturb the 's sense of table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else
if you go here , do it on his
best meal in a long time !
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening

i had the lamb special which was perfect
my father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience
the food is great and the environment is even better

taking hot dogs to the next level
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n't just get your average hot dog

had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour
when the main course finally arrived another half of our order was missing
never got an explanation as to what was going on
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues
ca n't believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients

what a hassle !
the food is very good , but not outstanding
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table

on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff
expensive
the bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty

i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us

the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , can i help you '' and how many are in your party ''
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were
we did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and customer service

i generally like this place
the food is good
the design of the space is good
but the service is horrid !
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it
i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff
